        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Derelict is a collection of dynamic bindings to C and C++ libraries for the D programming language. It enables users to easily access popular libraries such as OpenGL, SDL, Lua and more, easily and with little effort across several platforms.</p>

        <p>This set of documentation provides users with the necessary knowledge to get started Derelict, including general information applicable to all packages in the collection as well as package-specific information for each package. It is recommended that new Derelict users read the general documentation as well as the specific documentation for whichever packages are needed.</p>
