        <h2>Building and Linking</h2>

        <p>All of the Derelict packages are configured for convenient compilation via <a href="http://code.dlang.org/download">DUB</a>, the build and package tool for D. There are two ways to go about using DUB to compile any Derelict package for your projects. The recommended way is to use DUB to manage your own project. This is easiest and requires little effort to configure. If you do not use DUB to manage your project, then you will need to use it to compile the Derelict libraries you need to use and then configure your preferred build system or IDE to find the Derelict source and libraries.</p>

        <h3>When Using DUB to Manage Your Project</h3>

        <p>Using this approach, you never have to clone any of the Derelict packages in Git. DUB will take care of pulling down the source of any Derelict packages you need to use, compiling it, and linking it with your executable. It can also make sure that you have the very latest release of the packages you are using. You can find a great many DUB-enabled libraries other than Derelict in the <a href="http://code.dlang.org/">DUB Package Registry</a>, all of which can also be automatically compiled and linked with your project just by editing a configuration file.</p>

        <p>When creating a project for DUB to manage, a configuration file of the name dub.json needs to be provided. This is not a tutorial on general DUB use, so to learn more about how to configure compile settings and more, please see the <a href="http://code.dlang.org/package-format">package format documentation</a>. To find help with using DUB, vist the <a href="forum.rejectedsoftware.com/groups/rejectedsoftware.dub/">DUB forums</a>.

        <p>To use any package from the DerelictOrg collection in your project, you'll simply need to add the package to your dub.json configuration as a dependency. When you execute <code>dub</code> (which builds and runs the executable) or <code>dub build</code> (which builds the executable but does not run it) in the directory where your dub.json configuration lives, DUB will make sure that the dependencies are installed, compiled and linked. You can upgrade to the latest version of your project's dependencies by executing <code>dub upgrade</code> in the same directory.</p>

        <p>All packages from DerelictOrg are registered in the DUB registry under names that are formatted in a specific way, derived from the package name. For example, the package DerelictSDL2 is registered as <code>"derelict-sdl2"</code> and the package DerelictGL3 as <code>"derelict-gl3"</code>. Every official Derelict package follows that pattern.</p>

        <p>Some people maintain Derelict-style packages, using DerelictUtil as a foundation, outside of the DerelictOrg group. These projects tend to use a similar format for registered names, with the addition of the word <code>"extras"</code>. For example, a third-party package called DerelictFoo would be registered as <code>"derelict-extras-foo"</code>. Please be aware that the DerelictOrg maintainers are not responsible for such packages and any support requests should be directed to the person or people who are.</p>

        <p>To enable any package from the DUB registry, including the Derelict packages, in your DUB-managed project, simply add the registered package name, coupled with a version string, as a dependency in your dub.json configuration. For example, a project using both DerelictSDL2 and DerelictGL3 would add something like the following:</p>

        <pre>
        "dependencies": {
            "derelict-sdl2": "~>1.1.9",
            "derelict-gl3": ">=1.0.9"
        }
        </pre>

        <p>This specifies a version of DerelictSDL2 greater than or equal to 1.1.9 and less than 1.2.0, along with any version of DerelictGL3 greater than or eqaul to 1.0.9. When compiling the first time, DUB will check the local system for any version matching the cronstraints and, if none is found, will fetch the latest from git that does match. Later, when running <code>dub upgrade</code>, DUB will look to see if a newer version that matches the cronstraints is available. For more information on DUB dependencies, see the <a href="http://code.dlang.org/package-format">DUB package documentation</a>.</p>
