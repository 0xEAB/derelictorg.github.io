            <h2>Using Derelict</h2>

            <p>All of the packages in Derelict are <em>dynamic bindings</em>. Dynamic bindings may not be suitable for every application. Sometimes, <em>static bindings</em> may be more desirable. Before learning how to compile, link and run programs using Derelict, it is useful to understand the difference between the two types of bindings. The page on <a href="using/dynstat.html">Dynamic Bindings and Static Bindings</a> explains this along with some terminology used in this documentation that will be helpful when discussing Derelict with others.</p>

            <p>Once the decision to use Derelict has been made, the next step is to decide how to manage the project. Derelict is designed to work out of the box with <a href="http://code.dlang.org/download" target="_blank">DUB</a>, the build tool and package manager for D. When using Derelict, it is most convenient to use DUB to build and manage the entire application, but it is not required. As long as DUB is available to build the Derelict libraries, they can be used with any build tool or IDE. The page on <a href="using/build.html">Building and Linking Derelict</a> explains the steps required for both cases. The remainder of this page explains how to use Derelict at run time.</p>
