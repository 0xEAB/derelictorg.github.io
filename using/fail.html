            <h2>Failure to Load</h2>

            <p>Sometimes, a library cannot be loaded. There are a handful of reasons why this may happen. In each case, Derelict will throw an exception. There is a way to prevent exceptions from being thrown.</p>

            <h3>Loader Exceptions</h3>

            <p>When a shared library cannot be loaded, the ader will throw a sublcass of <code>DerelictException</code>, which in turn is a subclass of D's <code>Exception</code>. More specifically, a <code>SymbolLoadException</code> is thrown when a function is not found in the shared library. A <code>SharedLibLoadException</code> is found when a shared library is not present on the system path, or fails to load into memory for some other reason.</p>

            <p>The loader will attempt to load every library name that it is given. It will only throw a <code>SharedLibLoadException</code> when the last library name fails to load. When any given function fails to load, loading will be aborted and a <code>SymbolLoadException</code> thrown immediately. To catch and manipulate any of these excptions, import <code>derelict.util.exception</code></p>

            <p>In some cases, it may be desirable that the loader continue and no exception be thrown when a symbol is missing. For example, when a Derelict package has been updated to support the latest version of a C library, but the user wants to continue supporting the older version of the C library. One option is to use <code>SharedLibVersion</code> with any loaded that supports it. See <a href="load.html">Loading a Shared Library</a> for more information. Where <code>SharedLibVersion</code> is not supported, there are two possibilites. The recommended approach is to continue using the version of the Derelict package that supports the minimally required version of the C library. The other option is to use a library a feature called <em>selective symbol loading</em>.</p>

            <h3>Selective Symbol Loading</h3>

            <p>Selective symbol loading is a means of telling a Derelict loader that it is okay to continue loading a library when a specific symbol is missing. Each loader has a <code>missingSymbolCallback</code> property which can be set to either a D delegate or function pointer. The signature in both cases is the same. An example usage follows.</p>

            <pre>
            // This is needed for the return type enum.
            import derelict.util.exception;

            import derelict.sdl2.sdl;

            ShouldThrow myMissingSymCB( string symbolName )
            {
                if( symbolName == "SDL2_SomeFuncIDon'tNeed" )
                {
                    return ShouldThrow.No;
                }
                else
                {
                    return ShouldThrow.Yes;
                }
            }

            void main()
            {
                // Set the callback *before* calling load
                DerelictSDL2.missimgSymbolCallback = &myMissingSymCB;
                DerelictSDL2.load();
            }
            </pre>

            <p>The use of the <code>ShouldThrow</code> enum makes it easier to remember which value to return when implementing the callback. A simple <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> can sometimes be confusing: does <code>true</code> mean throw or don't throw? Because of the enum, <code>derelict.util.exception</code> must be imported, but there is no confusion.</p>

            <p>The important point here is that the callback must be set <strong>before</strong> calling the <code>load</code> method. Otherwise, the loader will have no callback to call. Also note that this is a very basic example. There is usually more than one function that must be ignored. When using a <code>MissingSymbolCallback</code>, it is imperative to check the change log for each new version of the C library to understand what has changed between versions so that a complete set of symbol names can be covered. The <code>SharedLibVersion</code> feature, where supported, uses selective symbol loading internally.</p>
