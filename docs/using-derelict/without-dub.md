When using a build system besides DUB, or an IDE, to manage your poject, the first thing you need to do is to determine which Derelict packages you actually need. For the purposes of the example to follow, a project using DerelictGLFW3 and DerelictGL3 will be assumed. Both, like all Derelict packages, have a dependency on DerelictUtil. All three of these packages will need to be obtained manually. One way is to clone them from their git repositories, but then you need to make sure you have the correct branches activated for the version you need of each. It's simpler to perform a manual fetch with DUB and let it manage the versions for you.
