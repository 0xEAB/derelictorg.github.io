A forum used to be maintained specifically for Derelict discussion and support, but it was taken down as the result of a server move and never reopened. There are plans to open a new forum at some point in the future, but for now the best methods to find help with Derelict are, in no particular order:

* Vist the IRC channel #D on freenode.net. A number of Derelict users are active there.
* Email Mike Parker via [aldacron@gmail.com].
* Users new to both D and Derelict might visit the [D Newsgroups], specifically `digitalmars.D.learn`, which can be accessed via Vladimir Panteleev's [web interface] and a [mailing list interface] in addition to standard newsreaders. However, please be aware that this is a generic D newsgroup and not specifically a Derelict support forum. Mike usually checks the newgroups at least once a day, and other regular participants are familiar with Derelict, but there are no guarantees a question about Derelict will be answered promptly.
