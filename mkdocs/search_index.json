It enables users to access popular libraries such as OpenGL, SDL, Lua and more, easily and with little effort across several platforms. This set of documentation provides users with the necessary knowledge to get started with Derelict, including general information applicable to all packages in the collection and package-specific information for each package. It is recommended that new Derelict users read the general documentation first, followed by the specific documentation for any packages they intend to use.\n\n\nAll Derelict packages are configured to support \nDUB\n, the D build tool and package manager, and are implemented on top of a common foundation in the form of DerelictUtil. The sections of this documentation that are not package-specific outline the common steps required to configure a project to build and link with Derelict packages, and highlight the common interface all Derelict packages share.\n\n\nWhile the steps to use most Derelict packages are identical, there are sometimes exceptions to the rule. Furthermore, each package has its own versioning scheme independent of the C or C++ library to which it binds. Because of this, before implementing Derelict in a project, it is advised to take the time to read the specific documentation for any packages the project makes use of. This will ensure the project is based on the version of the package appropriate to its requirements and any special steps the package requires can be understood.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNot all packages are currently documented. This is a work in progress.",

Before learning how to compile, link and run programs using Derelict, it is useful to understand the difference between the two types of bindings. The page \nAbout Bindings\n explains this along with other terminology used in this documentation that will be helpful when discussing Derelict with others.\n\n\nOnce the decision to use Derelict has been made, the next step is to decide how to manage the project. Derelict is designed to work out of the box with \nDUB\n, the build tool and package manager for D. When using Derelict, it is most convenient to use DUB to build and manage the entire application, but it is not required. As long as DUB is available to build the Derelict libraries, they can be used with any build tool or IDE. The pages on \ncompiling and linking\n explains the steps required for both cases. \n\n\nThe last part of this section deals with how to use Derelict at runtime. All Derelict packages have a basic common interface that allow the shared libraries to which they bind to be easily loaded. This is covered in pages on \nloading Derelict packages\n and \nload failures\n. Some packages may provide additional features, such as the option to link with a static C library (in which case no loading is needed), or may require additional steps after the library is loaded.

            "text": "The bindings in Derelict are primarily \ndynamic bindings\n, as opposed to those in the \nDeimos project\n which are all \nstatic bindings\n. This page aims to clarify the difference between the two types of bindings. It is important when starting a new project to understand the implications of each and to select the appropriate type in order to avoid unnecessary frustration.\n\n\nTerminology\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore getting to the differences between the two types of bindings, it would help to understand some relevant terminology as used throughout this documentation. This is especially important since the words \nstatic\n and \ndynamic\n are commonly used in multiple contexts. Understanding the terminology will help to avoid confusion in online discussions or when asking for help.\n\n\n\n\nbinding\n -- a direct interface to a library in one language that enables the library to be used in another language. Typically, the binding provides a one-to-one mapping to the original interface. For example, the names of all type and function declarations in the Derelict packages correspond exactly to those declared in the original C libraries, except in cases where the original API uses a variable or type name that is a keyword in D. Bindings are sometimes mistakenly referred to as \nwrappers\n.\n\n\nwrapper\n -- a higher-level interface to a library. Wrappers are typically written in the same language as the underlying API, either that of the original library or a binding to that library. For example, a wrapper for OpenGL written in D would be written on top of an OpenGL binding that is also written in D, while a C++ wrapper would be written on top of the C library directly. Wrappers typically provide functionality that makes using the library more convenient. For example, an OpenGL wrapper for D might use classes to represent OpenGL objects such as textures and shaders, encapsulating commonly grouped function calls into single class methods. None of the packages in Derelict are wrappers. They are all bindings. However, D wrappers can be made that use Derelict packages to interface with the C libraries. For example, an OpenGL wrapper can be written on top of \nDerelictGL3\n.\n\n\nstatic linking\n -- occurs right after the compile step when building an exectuable with a statically compiled language such as C, C++ or D. All of the object files generated by the compiler are fed to a \nlinker\n, which \nlinks\n them together, along with any \nstatic libraries\n that the application may need, in order to generate the final executable. A static library is an archive containing precompiled object files that are all combined into the final executable. Static libraries on Windows tend to have the \n.lib\n file extension; static libraries on Posix systems tend to have \n.a\n extensions. Since the objects in a static library become a part of the executable, they add to its file size. When a new version of a static library is released with bug fixes and improvements, all applications that use that library must be recompiled against the new version in order to benefit from the changes.\n\n\ndynamic linking\n -- as with static linking, this happens just after the compile step when building an executable with a statically compiled language such as C, C++ or D. However, instead of linking with a static library, the linker links with a \nshared library\n directly or, on Windows systems, with an \nimport library\n (which, confusingly, will have the same \n.lib\n file extension as a static library). Shared libraries are referred to as \ndynamic link libraries\n on Windows (usually with the \n.dll\n extension) and as \nshared objects\n on most Posix systems (with the \n.so\n extension). On Mac OS X, one can find shared object files, \ndynamic libraries\n with the \n.dylib\n extension, as well as Mac-specific \nframeworks\n. Though the names and file formats may be different, all shared libraries are fundamentally the same. Unlike static libraries, they \nare not\n combined into the final executable at link time. Instead, information for the system loader is inserted into the executable by the linker. The OS can use this information at run time to load the shared library into memory when the application starts. This allows a single library to be shared by multiple applications, which makes executables smaller and allows all applications using the same library to benefit when the library is updated with bug fixes or improvements, without the need to recompile any of them. It also means that the shared library must be available on the end-user's system in a location that resides on the system library search path.\n\n\ndynamic loading\n -- this is a means of using shared libraries without a link step after compilation. Instead, the shared libraries are loaded manually by the executable at run time. To be clear, dynamic linking has a link-time dependency when the final executable is generated and the OS will automatically load the relevant shared libraries at run time; \ndynamic loading\n has no link-time dependency and the executable can be generated by the linker without the shared libraries being present on the system. In order for dynamic loading to work, the program must make use of OS-specific APIs (or third-party wrappers) to load the shared libraries into the process memory space. Since the linker is not used to generate locations in memory for the shared library's symbols, the program must declare pointers to the symbols in the shared library that it wants to use and manually match them with the symbols in the shared library after loading it into memory. In other words, the shared library is loaded manually rather than automatically. The shared library must also be available on the end-user's system in a location that is on the system library search path, otherwise the system APIs will not be able to find it. Aside from eliminating link-time dependencies, this approach allows different implementations of a shared library's interface to be easily swapped at run time.\n\n\n\n\nDynamic vs. Static Bindings\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe primary difference between a dynamic and a static binding is that the former has no link-time dependency on the library to which it binds. Both types require that the bindings themselves be either linked with the executable or compiled along with the application. However, static bindings have the additional requirement that the bound library must be either statically linked (with a static library) or dynamically linked (with a shared library) when the executable is generated. Dynamic bindings make use of dynamic loading to load shared libraries at run time and, therefore, have no link-time dependencies beyond the binding itself. This is explained below.\n\n\nStatic Bindings\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe source code for static bindings in D, like those found in the \nDeimos project\n, tends to look very similar to the C or C++ headers for the C library to which they bind. Functions are declared with no implementation. For example:\n\n\nextern\n(\nC\n)\n \nvoid\n \nSomeFunction\n(\nint\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven a C library, \nMyLib\n, which exposes the function \nSomeFunction\n declared above, the user of the D binding for \nMyLib\n must either statically link with the \nMyLib\n static library (\nMyLib.lib\n on Windows, \nlibMylib.a\n elsewhere) or with the \nMyLib\n shared library (the import library \nMyLib.lib\n on Windows, or \nlibMyLib.so\n elsewhere). Additionally, the user must also link with the \nMyLib\n binding itself, most often as a static library, if it contains anything more than function and type delcarations or templates, e.g. non-templated helper functions that have implementations.\n\n\nOn Windows, there can be some effort required to link with the C library. At issue is the object file format used by different linkers. For example, when compiling on 32-bit Windows, DMD uses the OPTLINK linker by default, which only understands the \nOMF object format\n. This is the format that was commonly used on Windows back in the DOS days. Modern Windows compilers and linkers more typically use \nCOFF\n instead. As such, most precompiled static and shared libraries available online are in the COFF format. To be used with the default 32-bit DMD toolchain, they must either be converted to OMF using a conversion tool, or the source for the library must be compiled with a compiler that generates OMF files, such as the \nDigital Mars C & C++ Compiler (DMC)\n. However, when compiling with DMD in 64-bit mode (the \n-m64\n switch) or with the \n-m32mscoff\n switch, \nDMD requires\n the Microsoft C and C++ build tools. The Microsoft linker understands the COFF format, so the conversion step is not necessary. Detailing the object file formats used by every D compiler is beyond the scope of this documentation. It's up to the user to know the output of the tools being used.\n\n\nDifferent people may see different benefits and drawbacks to using static bindings. One of the biggest benefits, perhaps, is that a static binding offers a choice between statically linking with and dynamically linking with a C library. However, no matter which type of linking is chosen, there is no way to escape the link-time dependency imposed by a static binding.\n\n\nDynamic Bindings\n\u00b6\n\n\nNot only are dynamic bindings used differently than static bindings, they are implemented differently. Normal function prototypes do not work with dynamic bindings because of the fact that such bindings make use of dynamic loading. All of the functions in the bound library must be declared in the binding as function pointers. The \nMyLib\n example above converted to a dynamic binding format in D might look something like this:\n\n\nextern\n(\nC\n)\n \nalias\n \np_SomeFunction\n \n=\n \nvoid\n \nfunction\n(\nint\n);\n\n\np_SomeFunction\n \nSomeFunction\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen an application using the \nMyLib\n dynamic binding is compiled, there is no link-time dependency beyond the binding itself. At run time, the user of the dynamic binding must typically call a function to load the \nMyLib\n shared library (unless the binding is configured to do it automatically, such as via a static constructor in D). The loader will first call into the OS API to load the shared library into the application's memory space. After that, it will again call into the OS API to fetch the address of the \nSomeFunction\n implementation and assign it to the \nSomeFunction\n variable declared above. If successful, then \nSomeFunction\n is ready to use from that point on. In Derelict, dynamic loading is done through a loader in the DerelictUtil library, which is why the library is a dependency of each binding in Derelict. \n\n\nAside from eliminating the link-time dependency on the bound library, dynamic bindings give the client control over the case where the shared library fails to load, an event which typically occurs when the library is missing from the end user's system, it's missing some symbols the program expects to find, or is otherwise corrupt. When using a static binding with dynamic linking, the OS itself reports an error in these cases, which may not always be desirable. Because a dynamic binding uses dynamic loading, it is possible for the application to detect such errors and react in a manner appropriate for the application, such as displaying a message box with a link to a tech support page.\n\n\nConclusion\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe information above is intended to shed light on the differences between static and dynamic bindings. Generally, neither type of binding is \"better\" than the other. For most applications, it probably doesn't matter which type is used as long as the application programmer is comfortable with the concepts of compiling, linking, and loading. The pros and cons of each approach can take on different weights in different contexts, but debating or explaining such is beyond the scope of this documentation.",

Where possible, suggestions on how to obtain binaries and/or source are included in the package-specific documentation.\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating a project for DUB to manage, a configuration file of the name \ndub.json\n or \ndub.sdl\n must be provided. This documentation is not a tutorial on general DUB use, so to learn more about using DUB from the command line and configuring DUB packages, please see the \nDUB documentation\n. For more DUB assitance, visit the \nDUB forums\n.\n\n\nTo use any package from the DerelictOrg collection in your project, you'll simply need to add it to your project configuration as a dependency.

You can upgrade to the latest version of each of your project's dependencies by executing \ndub upgrade\n in the same directory.\n\n\nAll packages from DerelictOrg are registered in the DUB registry under names that are formatted in a specific format derived from the package name.

Some of these packages are registred with names using a format that puts \nderelict-extras\n in front of the package name. For example, a third-party package called DerelictFoo might be registered as \nderelict-extras-foo\n. While this approach is encouraged, many such packages are still registered as \nderelict-foo\n.

Please be aware that the DerelictOrg maintainers are not responsible for such packages and any support requests should be directed to the person or persons who are responsible via the links to their source repositories from the package pages at the \nDUB Package Registry\n.\n\n\nTo enable any package from the DUB registry in a DUB-managed project, simply add the registered package name, coupled with a version string, as a dependency in the project configuration. For example, a project using both DerelictSDL2 and DerelictGL3 would have something like the following in its configuration:\n\n\ndub.json\n\n\n\"dependencies\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"derelict-sdl2\"\n:\n \n\"~>3.0.0\"\n,\n\n    \n\"derelict-gl3\"\n:\n \n\"~>2.0.0\"\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndub.sdl\n\n\ndependency \n\"derelict-sdl2\"\n \nversion\n=\n\"~>3.0.0\"\n\ndependency \n\"derelict-gl3\"\n \nversion\n=\n\"~>2.0.0\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis specifies a version of DerelictSDL2 \ngreater than or equal to\n \n2.0.0\n and \nless than\n \n2.1.0\n, and similarly for DerelictGL3 \n1.0.18\n - \n1.1.0\n. When compiling a project for the first time, DUB will check the local system for any version that satisfies the constraints and, if none is found, will fetch from git a version that does. Later, when running \ndub upgrade\n, DUB will look to see if a newer version which satisfies the constraints is available. For more information on DUB dependencies, see the \nDUB documentation\n and the \nDUB Wiki page\n on version management. See the page \nLatest Versions\n for a table of all of the latest release version tags for the supported DerelictOrg packages.\n\n\nDynamic bindings\n\u00b6\n\n\nAll Derelict packages are configured as dynamic bindings by default (see \nthis page\n to understand the difference between static and dynamic bindings). This does not mean they require dynamic linking. There is no link-time dependency at all. Instead, the C shared library is loaded manually at runtime with a call to a \nload\n function on a loader instance, e.g. \nDerelictSDL2.load\n.\n\n\nFor this to work, the shared library needs to be on the system path. On Posix systems, that usually means installing the C library via the system package manager. It is not necessary to install the C library's development packages for this to work, given the lack of a link-time dependency. For example, Ubuntu users can install SDL via \nsudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0\n, but need not install \nlibsdl2-dev\n. On Windows, this usually means placing the C DLL in the executable's directory, though \nDerelict loaders\n support loading from custom locations, e.g. \nDerelictSDL2.load(\"dlls/SDL2.dll\")\n.\n\n\nStatic bindings\n\u00b6\n\n\nDerelict packages that support a static binding configuration can be configured using a \nsubConfiguration\n entry in the project config, or a \nversions\n entry. The subconfigurations are in the format of \npackage-name-static\n, e.g. \nderelict-sdl2-static\n. This is the preferred approach, as it completely eliminates the dynamic binding modules from the build.\n\n\ndub.json\n\n\n\"dependencies\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"derelict-sdl2\"\n:\n \n\"~>3.0.0\"\n\n\n}\n,\n\n\n\"subConfigurations\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"derelict-sdl2\"\n:\n \n\"derelict-sdl2-static\"\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndub.sdl\n\n\ndependency \n\"derelict-sdl2\"\n \nversion\n=\n\"~>3.0.0\"\n\nsubConfiguration \n\"derelict-sdl2\"\n \n\"derelict-sdl2-static\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersions can be \nDerelict_Static\n, which enables the static binding configuration for all packages in a project that support it, or \nPackageName_Static\n, e.g. \nDerelictSDL2_Static\n which enables it for the specific package.\n\n\ndub.json\n\n\n\"dependencies\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"derelict-sdl2\"\n:\n \n\"~>3.0.0\"\n\n\n}\n,\n\n\n\"versions\"\n:\n \n[\n\"DerelictSDL2_Static\"\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndub.sdl\n\n\ndependency \n\"derelict-sdl2\"\n \nversion\n=\n\"~>3.0.0\"\n\nversions \n\"DerelictSDL2_Static\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic binding configurations require linking either dynamically or statically with the library at runtime. Generally, on Posix systems this requires installing the development version of the C library through a package manager or compiling from source. The appropriate libraries will be installed on the system path. On Windows, it requires downloading the precompiled development packages or compiling from source, making sure the linker can find the library, and, when linking dynamically, ensuring the DLL is in the compiled executable's directory.\n\n\nThe documentation for each package that supports static binding provides package-specific details.",

The binaries for the C libraries must be obtained separately, either through downloading precompiled binaries from project websites, repositories, or third-party packagers, or by downloading and obtaining the source. Where possible, suggestions on how to obtain binaries and/or source are included in the package-specific documentation.   When creating a project for DUB to manage, a configuration file of the name  dub.json  or  dub.sdl  must be provided. This documentation is not a tutorial on general DUB use, so to learn more about using DUB from the command line and configuring DUB packages, please see the  DUB documentation . For more DUB assitance, visit the  DUB forums .  To use any package from the DerelictOrg collection in your project, you'll simply need to add it to your project configuration as a dependency. When you execute  dub  or  dub build  in your project configuration's root directory, DUB will make sure that the dependencies are installed, compiled and linked. You can upgrade to the latest version of each of your project's dependencies by executing  dub upgrade  in the same directory.  All packages from DerelictOrg are registered in the DUB registry under names that are formatted in a specific format derived from the package name. For example, the package DerelictSDL2 is registered as  derelict-sdl2  and the package DerelictGL3 as  derelict-gl3 . Every Derelict package under the DerelictOrg umbrella follows that pattern.  Some people maintain third-party Derelict-style packages, using DerelictUtil as a foundation, outside of the DerelictOrg group. Some of these packages are registred with names using a format that puts  derelict-extras  in front of the package name. For example, a third-party package called DerelictFoo might be registered as  derelict-extras-foo . While this approach is encouraged, many such packages are still registered as  derelict-foo . Still others might use another format entirely. Please be aware that the DerelictOrg maintainers are not responsible for such packages and any support requests should be directed to the person or persons who are responsible via the links to their source repositories from the package pages at the  DUB Package Registry .

            "text": "When using an IDE or any build system other than DUB to manage a project using Derelict, the Derelict packages must be manually compiled and configured. \n\n\nThe first thing to do is to determine which Derelict packages are required. In the example to follow, a hypothetical project using \nDerelictGLFW3\n and \nDerelictGL3\n serves as an example. Let's assume a project directory tree that looks like this:\n\n\n- rootDir\n-- bin\n-- libs\n-- source\n-- third-party\n--- derelict\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Derelict packages have a dependency on DerelictUtil. All three of these packages will need to be obtained and compiled. DUB is the only build tool supported, but there are two recommended ways to obtain the sources.\n\n\nCloning packages with git\n\u00b6\n\n\nAll of the official Derelict packages reside in repositories on GitHub under the \nDerelictOrg\n umbrella organization, making each package available via a simple \ngit clone\n command. For our hypothetical project, that would look like this:\n\n\ncd\n rootdir/third-party/derelict\ngit clone https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictGLFW3.git glfw3\ngit clone https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictGL3 gl3\ngit clone https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictUtil util\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to satisfy the DerelictUtil dependency for the DerelictGLFW3 and DerelictGL3 packages, you'll need make sure the DerelictUtil package is properly configured. First, you need to make sure you know which version of DerelictUtil each package requires and that each package depends on the same version of DerelictUtil, e.g. you can't mix DerelictUtil \n2.x\n and \n3.x\n in the same project. The documentation page for each package includes a table that displays that information. For our example, let's assume we want DerelictGL3 version \n2.0.x\n and DerelictGLFW3 version \n4.0.x\n. Looking at the \nDerelictGL3\n and \nDerelictGLFW3\n docs, we see that both depend on version \n3.0.x\n of DerelictUtil.\n\n\nIn most cases, you'll want to use the latest version of each package. The master branch of each git repository usually corresponds to the latest release branch and, generally, an effort is made to ensure that patch releases are pushed out as soon as \nmaster\n is updated so that the two branches always stay in sync. However, now and again changes are allowed to accumulate in \nmaster\n over the course of a few days, so there is always a possibility it might be unstable.\n\n\nTo play it safe, go into the new \nutil\n directory and checkout the \n3.0\n branch:\n\n\ncd\n util\ngit checkout \n3\n.0\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally, that will serve you just fine. It gives you the source of the latest \n3.0.x\n patch release and you can update it any time you want via \ngit pull\n to get any new patch releases when they arrive. However, if you want to freeze at a specific patch release, or use an older one, you can checkout a specific release tag. You can use any patch release that satisifies the dependency version contstraint in each of the Derelict packages you intend to use, e.g. DerelictUtil \n3.1.0\n does not satisfy the constraint \n~>3.0.\n, but \n3.0.2\n does. It's recommended to give the new branch a custom name:\n\n\ncd\n util\ngit checkout tags/v3.0.0 -b \n3\n.0.0-local\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the DerelictUtil source is configured to the proper branch, DUB needs to be told where to find it. For this, we can use \ndub add-local\n, which takes a directory name and an optional version number as an argument. For this example, all we need is the directory name. Since we changed into the \nutil\n directory in the step above, that means the current directory symbol, \n.\n, is sufficient.\n\n\ndub add-local .\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, if you're still in the parent directory, it would be:\n\n\ndub add-local util\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that, we're ready to build the DerelictGL3 and DerelictGLFW3 packages. Again, you can choose to build the master branch of each, checkout the latest branch that correponds to the latest release, or checkout a specific tag. For our example, we'll checkout the latest release branches.\n\n\nAssuming we're already in the \nutil\n directory:\n\n\ndub build -b release -ax86_64\n\ncd\n ../gl3\ngit checkout \n2\n.0\ndub build -brelease -ax86_64\n\ncd\n ../glfw3\ngit checkout \n4\n.0\ndub build -brelease -ax86_64\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will build optimized 64-bit versions of each library. To build debug versions, omit the \n-brelease\n flag. To build 32-bit binaries, omit the \n-ax86_64\n. On Windows, to build 32-bit COFF binaries, replace \n-ax86_64\n with \n-x86_mscoff\n.\n\n\nThe above commands should have produced files like \nutil\\lib\\DerelictUtil.lib\n on Windows and \nutil/lib/libDerelictUtil.a\n elsewhere for each package. To use the packages in your project, you need to configure your build tool or IDE to find these libraries along with the source. The import path needs to be set to include the \nsource\n directory of each packge, e.g. \nglfw3/source\n. Addtionally, either the library path must be set to the \nlib\n directory of each package, e.g. \nglfw3/lib\n, or the linker needs to be configured with the full path to each of the libraries. How this is done depends upon the build system you're using. \n\n\nAlternatively, you can copy all of the source files to a common root directory and/or all the libraries to a common directory. In our example directory tree, you might create a \nthird-party/import\n directory, then copy the source for each package into that directory. If you take this approach, be sure to copy the entire tree below the \nsource\n directory in each package, e.g. for DerelictUtil, don't just copy the files in the \nutil\n subdirectory, but the entire tree below \nsource\n such that you end up with \nimport\\derelict\\util\n in your project tree. This way, you only need to add one directory to the import path, \nthird-party/import\n, instead of one directory per package. You might do the same with the libraries, copying each into a \nthird-party/lib\n directory, e.g. \nthird-party/lib/DerelictUtil.lib\n.\n\n\nFetching packages with dub\n\u00b6\n\n\nUsing the same hypothetical project as the example in the previous section, we'll see how to obtain DerelictGL3 \n2.0.0\n, DerelictGLFW3 \n4.0.0\n, and DerelictUtil \n3.0.0\n via \ndub\n. Note that using this approach is akin to cloning the repositories with git and checking out out a specific git tag.\n\n\nStarting from the same project root directory as above, the following commands will manually fetch each package.\n\n\ncd derelict\ndub fetch --cache=local derelict-glfw3 --version=4.0.0\ndub fetch --cache=local derelict-gl3 --version=2.0.0\ndub fetch --cache=local derelict-util --version=3.0.0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n--cache=local\n argument causes each package to be installed in subdirectories named using the \npackage-name-x.x.x\n format, e.g. \nderelict-glfw3-4.0.0\n. Each of these directories will contain a subdirectory that matches the DUB package name, e.g. \nderelict-glfw3-4.0.0/derelict-glfw3\n. This second subdirectory is the package root. \n\n\nAs before, DUB needs to be told where to find DerelictUtil.\n\n\ndub add-local derelict-util-3.0.0/derelict-util\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that, all three packages are ready to build.\n\n\ncd derelict-glfw3-4.0.0/derelict-glfw3\ndub build -brelease -ax86_64\ncd ../derelict-gl3-2.0.0/derelict-gl3\ndub build -brelease -ax86_64\ncd ../derelict-util-3.0.0/derelict-util\ndub build -brelease -ax86_64\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will build optimized 64-bit versions of each library. To build debug versions, omit the \n-brelease\n flag. To build 32-bit binaries, omit the \n-ax86_64\n. On Windows, to build 32-bit COFF binaries, replace \n-ax86_64\n with \n-x86_mscoff\n. As described in the preceding section, your build system will now need to be configured to find the source and libraries for the Derelict packages you just compiled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA DerelictUtil caveat\n\n\nTechnically, it's not necessary to download and build DerelictUtil. When compiling the other two packages, DUB will fetch the version it needs and stash it in the global cache. However, you still need to get at the DerelictUtil static library and imports when building your program. If you're okay with pulling them out of the global cache (which is in the \nAppData\\Roaming\n user directory on modern Windows sytems and \n~/.dub\n on other systems) or pointing your build system to the proper directories, you need not follow the instructions to fetch and build DerelictUtil in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic binding configurations\n\n\nSome Derelict packages support a static binding configuration. When you want to use them this way, it may not be necessary to compile and link with them. When configured as a static binding, the package has no link-time dependency on DerelictUtil and only needs to be compiled if it implements any custom functions. DerelictGLFW3 does not, so to use it as a static binding, fetch it as described in the following sections, you can skip the build step. Then, when compiling your executable, make sure to compile with \n-version=DerelictGLFW3_Static\n. Some packages, such as DerelictSDL2, must still be compiled because they provide function implementations (typically C macros converted to D functions). In that case, when building the packages, specify the static binding configuration on the \ndub\n command line, e.g. \ndub build -cderelict-sdl2-static\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Linux\n\n\nWhen compiling executables that use Derelict dynamic bindings on Linux, it's necessary to link with \nlibdl\n. This is used by DerelictUtil to load shared libraries dynamically at runtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild system configuration\n\n\nFailure to properly configure the build system will result in compilation or linker errors. It is beyond the scope of this documentation to describe how to configure the various IDEs and build tools people may use with D. Learning to do so is entirely up to the user.",

Each of these directories will contain a subdirectory that matches the DUB package name, e.g.  derelict-glfw3-4.0.0/derelict-glfw3 . This second subdirectory is the package root.   As before, DUB needs to be told where to find DerelictUtil.  dub add-local derelict-util-3.0.0/derelict-util  With that, all three packages are ready to build.  cd derelict-glfw3-4.0.0/derelict-glfw3\ndub build -brelease -ax86_64\ncd ../derelict-gl3-2.0.0/derelict-gl3\ndub build -brelease -ax86_64\ncd ../derelict-util-3.0.0/derelict-util\ndub build -brelease -ax86_64  This will build optimized 64-bit versions of each library. To build debug versions, omit the  -brelease  flag. To build 32-bit binaries, omit the  -ax86_64 . On Windows, to build 32-bit COFF binaries, replace  -ax86_64  with  -x86_mscoff . As described in the preceding section, your build system will now need to be configured to find the source and libraries for the Derelict packages you just compiled.    A DerelictUtil caveat  Technically, it's not necessary to download and build DerelictUtil. When compiling the other two packages, DUB will fetch the version it needs and stash it in the global cache. However, you still need to get at the DerelictUtil static library and imports when building your program. If you're okay with pulling them out of the global cache (which is in the  AppData\\Roaming  user directory on modern Windows sytems and  ~/.dub  on other systems) or pointing your build system to the proper directories, you need not follow the instructions to fetch and build DerelictUtil in the following sections.    Static binding configurations  Some Derelict packages support a static binding configuration. When you want to use them this way, it may not be necessary to compile and link with them. When configured as a static binding, the package has no link-time dependency on DerelictUtil and only needs to be compiled if it implements any custom functions. DerelictGLFW3 does not, so to use it as a static binding, fetch it as described in the following sections, you can skip the build step. Then, when compiling your executable, make sure to compile with  -version=DerelictGLFW3_Static . Some packages, such as DerelictSDL2, must still be compiled because they provide function implementations (typically C macros converted to D functions). In that case, when building the packages, specify the static binding configuration on the  dub  command line, e.g.  dub build -cderelict-sdl2-static .    For Linux  When compiling executables that use Derelict dynamic bindings on Linux, it's necessary to link with  libdl . This is used by DerelictUtil to load shared libraries dynamically at runtime.    Build system configuration  Failure to properly configure the build system will result in compilation or linker errors. It is beyond the scope of this documentation to describe how to configure the various IDEs and build tools people may use with D. Learning to do so is entirely up to the user.",

The three major D compilers all use the system linker on those systems. The outlier is Windows. \n\n\nWhen using any Derelict package as a dynamic binding, none of the information on this page applies. It only applies when using any static binding, whether it be one of the Derelict packages that supports such a configuration or a non-Derelict library. In other words, when developing D programs that have a link-time dependency with third-party libraries on Windows, a few prerequisites need to be understood.\n\n\nOf the three main compilers, only DMD and LDC actively support Windows. GDC has not had a Windows release for some time (though that will likely change now that the compiler has been accepted into the GCC compiler suite). The following sections look at each compiler in turn.\n\n\nDownload links for all three compilers can be found at the \ndlang.org downloads page\n.\n\n\nDMD\n\u00b6\n\n\nDMD is the reference D compiler, developed primarily by D creator and \nDigital Mars\n owner, \nWalter Bright\n.\n\n\nDMD is built on top of the same compiler backend as the Digital Mars C/C++ compiler, \nDMC\n. It ships with \nOPTLINK\n, an ancient linker that only knows how to link 32-bit executables composed of object files in the \nOMF\n format. When passing the \n-m32\n command line switch (the default for the 32-bit version of DMD, currently the only version distributed in binary form on Windows), DMD's object output will be in the OMF format and it will use the OPTLINK linker to create executables.\n\n\nThankfully, DMD also supports generating object files in the \nCOFF\n format and linking using the Microsoft linker. This is enabled via the \n-m32mscoff\n command line switch for 32-bit binaries, and \n-m64\n for 64-bit binaries.This requires the installation of either the Microsoft Build Tools and the Windows SDK, or a supported version of Visual Studio. If you do not already have any of these installed, the easiest thing to do is to install the latest Visual Studio \nVisual Studio Community Edition\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGenerally, you can expect Visual Studio versions 2012 and later to be supported, though sometimes new versions may temporarily break support in some way. For example, due to changes in the path structure in VS 2017, the DMD installer could not automatically identify it for a time, so it could not properly configure DMD. Paths can always be configured manually, but VS 2015 renamed the C runtime library, the kind of breakage that can only be fixed by the DMD developers. Any breakage is generally fixed within a DMD release or two. In the interim, the previous Visual Studio version should continue to work.\n\n\n\n\nTo reiterate, when using the dynamic binding configuration of a Derelict package, the DLL can be in any format and compiled with any Windows compiler. As long as 32-bit executables are loading 32-bit DLLs, and 64-bit executables are loading 64-bit DLLs, the object file format is irrelevant. It only applies when linking in a static binding configuration.\n\n\nCOFF\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce the Microsoft linker and libraries are installed, DMD needs to be told where to find them. While it's possible to edit the DMD configuration file (\nsc.ini\n in the \ndmd2\\windows\\bin\n directory), it's much easier to let the DMD Windows installer handle it automatically (see \nthis D Blog post\n for more info). When everything is configured, any libraries that have a link-time dependency must be in the COFF format.\n\n\nEffectively, this means that when using a Derelict package in a static binding configuration (where supported), you should always either choose binary packages compiled with Visual C++, or use Visual C++ to compile the library yourself. For example, to use the \nDerelictSDL2\n static binding configuration, go to \nlibsdl.org\n and download the appropriate SDL development libraries for Visual C++, e.g. \nSDL-devel-2.0.5-VC.zip\n.\n\n\nOMF\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhy are you even thinking about compiling in OMF format? Just don't! But if you must, don't even bother to look for precompiled OMF binaries for any library to which Derelict binds. They may be out there somewhere, but you're better off either running an object converter on the COFF libraries or compiling them yourself with DMC. The former is the recommended approach, as few libraries have a build system that supports DMC out of the box.\n\n\nThe first thing to do is to head to the Digital Mars site to download the Extended Utility Package (\nEUP\n). This contains two tools that will do the job. When you are linking dynamically with a DLL import library, run the \ncoffimplib\n utility on the COFF DLL (such as the \nSDL2.dll\n obtained in the VC development archive from the SDL downloads page). This will produce an import library in OMF format that will link with the COFF DLL. When linking statically, run \ncoff2omf\n on the COFF static library or any COFF object files you need to link with. This will produce libraries or object files in the OMF format.\n\n\nLDC\n\u00b6\n\n\nOlder LDC releases for Windows were built on top of \nmingw-w64\n, but recent releases require the Microsoft tools and libraries.

Each binding contains a loader class that extends from \nSharedLibLoader\n, a class found in \nderelict.util.loader\n. This class exposes two methods for dynamically loading shared libraries.\n\n\nSome of the Derelict packages support a static binding configuration that eliminates the need to use a \nSharedLibLoader\n. Instead, the C library is linked either statically or dynamically when compiling the executable. This page is exclusively about using Derelict packages in the dynamic binding configuration.\n\n\nA normal load\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe method that most developers will use is called \nload\n and takes no arguments. The specific loader on which this method is called will attempt to find and load a shared library, using a predefined set of library names, on the default system shared library path. Loader instances are created automatically in module constructors and, by convention and with few exceptions, are named according to the Derelict package to which they belong.

On other platforms, the application directory and current working directory typically are not searched at all (see \nthis page\n for Linux and \nthis one\n for Mac OS X).\n\n\nThe default library names are selected for each Derelict package based on common formats for each operating system. Sometimes, it is necessary to bypass the default names. For example, a developer may decide to ship special copies of a shared library using a non-standard name, or storing them in a subdirectory under the application directory. In such a case, an overload of the \nload\n method should be used. One form accepts an array of strings, each a library name. Another overload takes a single string containing a comma-separated list of library names. Each name can include a path.

The recommended approach is to continue using the version of the Derelict package that supports the minimally required version of the C library. The other option is to use a library feature called  selective symbol loading .",

            "text": "Selective symbol loading is a means of telling a Derelict loader that it is okay to continue loading a library when a specific symbol is missing. Each loader has a  missingSymbolCallback  property which can be set to either a D delegate or function pointer. The signature in both cases is the same. An example usage follows.  // This is needed for the return type enum.  import   derelict . util . exception   :   ShouldThrow ;  import   derelict . sdl2 . sdl ;  ShouldThrow   myMissingSymCB (   string   symbolName   )  { \n     if (   symbolName   ==   \"SDL2_SomeFuncIDon'tNeed\"   ) \n     { \n         return   ShouldThrow . No ; \n     } \n     else \n     { \n         return   ShouldThrow . Yes ; \n     }  }  void   main ()  { \n     // Set the callback *before* calling load \n     DerelictSDL2 . missingSymbolCallback   =   & myMissingSymCB ; \n     DerelictSDL2 . load ();  }   The use of the  ShouldThrow  enum makes it easier to remember which value to return when implementing the callback. A simple  true  or  false  can sometimes be confusing: does  true  mean throw or don't throw? Because of the enum,  derelict.util.exception  must be imported, but there is no confusion.  The important point here is that the callback must be set  before  calling the  load  method. Otherwise, the loader will have no callback to call. Also note that this is a basic example. There is usually more than one function that must be ignored. When using a  MissingSymbolCallback , it is imperative to check the change log for each new version of the bound C library to understand what has changed between versions so that a complete set of symbol names can be covered. The  SharedLibVersion  feature , where supported, uses selective symbol loading internally.",

These differences are described in the relevant sections below.\n\n\nReleases\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe DUB package name of DerelictGL3 is \nderelict-gl3\n.\n\n\nThe current DUB package version is \n~>2.0.0-beta\n.\n\n\nUnlike other Derelict packages, DerelictGL3 releases do not correspond to any specific version of the C library. All versions of OpenGL are always supported, even though the \nSharedLibVersion\n construct is not. When a new version of OpenGL is released, support is added to the current DerelictGL3 release series and the patch number, rather than the minor number, is bumped in the new release version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerelictGL3 Version\n\n\ngit Branch\n\n\nOpenGL Version\n\n\nDerelictUtil Version\n\n\nSupported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.0-beta\n\n\nmaster\n/\n2.0\n\n\n3.2.x\n\n\n3.0.x\n\n\n\u2714\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.x\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n1.0 - 4.5\n\n\n1.0.x - 3.0.x\n\n\n\u2714\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n1.0.x\n series is compatible with all DerelictUtil versions, as long as it is compiled against and linked with the same version of DerelictUtil as an executable. Unfortunately, in an oversight lost to time, the \n1.0.x\n series uses a \nderelict-util\n dependency of \n>=1.0.3\n which disallows anything less than version \n1.0.3\n, but has no constraint on later versions. As such, it's possible to independently compile the DerelictGL3 library against version \n1.0.x\n or \n2.0.x\n of DerelictUtil, then attempt to link with DerelictUtil \n3.0.x\n when building the executable.\n\n\nIt's recommended to use DerelictGL3 \n1.0.x\n only when you need compatibility with the \n2.0.x\n series of DerelictUtil because of other Derelict packages. If you compile DerelictGL3 \n1.0.x\n independently, make sure you specify version \n2.0.x\n of DerelictUtil in your \ndub.selections.json\n file. Otherwise, DUB will pull down the latest DerelictUtil and link against it.\n\n\nDerelictGL3 \n3.0.x\n was overhauled to provide compile-time configuration of supported OpenGL versions and extensions. It also provides the option of wrapping all function declarations in a \nstruct\n, either automatically or in a custom type, to provide more efficient context management. All new projects should use this version. Support for the \n1.0.x\n series will be discontinued at some point in the future.\n\n\nUsing DerelictGL3\n\u00b6\n\n\nSee the generic documentation on \nCompiling and Linking\n for generic information on incorporating any Derelict package in your project.\n\n\nObtaining the binaries\n\u00b6\n\n\nOpenGL is available on Windows and Mac OS X out of the box. Windows users should upgrade their graphics card drivers to always have the latest version. Linux and *BSD users should consult their OS knowlege base or support forums to determine enable hardware-accelerated OpenGL.\n\n\nConfiguring OpenGL versions\n\u00b6\n\n\nOut of the box, DerelictGL3 will attempt to load all available OpenGL versions as free functions, i.e. not wrapped in a struct. This can be overridden by adding a \nversions\n directive to a project's DUB configuration with one of the following values.\n\n\n\n\nDerelictGL3_CustomFreeFuncs\n\n\n\n\nWhen this version is specified, the DerelictGL3 modules will not declare any types or function pointers. This must be handled by the user using a mixin template, \nglFreeFuncs\n. The following enables only OpenGL versions 3.3 and lower:\n\n\nmodule\n \nmygl\n;\n\n\npublic\n \nimport\n \nderelict\n.\nopengl\n;\n\n\nmixin\n \nglFreeFuncs\n!(\nGLVersion\n.\ngl33\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will enable all of the OpenGL types and function pointers for every version up to OpenGL 3.3 into the \nmygl\n module. Modules that need to call OpenGL functions should import \nmygl\n.\n\n\nglFreeFuncs\n takes an optional parameter that will include deprecated types and function pointer declarations. This is \nfalse\n by default, but can be enabled with, e.g., \nmixin glFreeFuncs(GLVersion.gl33, true);\n.\n\n\nWith no arguments, \nglFreeFuncs\n will enable all supported versions of OpenGL without deprecations. This is the default behavior.\n\n\n\n\nDerelictGL3_Contexts\n\n\n\n\nThis will configure DerelictGL3 to load the OpenGL function pointers into a \nstruct\n. To use the default implementation, mixin the \nglContext\n template along with the desired version:\n\n\nmodule\n \nmygl\n;\n\n\npublic\n \nimport\n \nderelict\n.\nopengl\n;\n\n\nmixin\n \nglContext\n!(\nGLVersion\n.\ngl33\n);\n\n\nGLContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will enable all of the types and function pointers for every version up to OpenGL 3.3 into the \nmygl\n module, wrapping the function pointers (but not the types) into a structure named \nGLContext\n, and create an instance of that type named \ncontext\n. OpenGL functions can then be called via the \ncontext\n instance, e.g. \ncontext.glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n.\n\n\nDeprecated types and functions can be enabled by passing \ntrue\n as a second argument to \nglContext\n. With no arguments, \nglContext\n will load all supported versions of OpenGL without deprecations (the default behavior).\n\n\nCustom contexts are also supported, but they require a bit of string and template \nmixin\n boilerplate.\n\n\nmodule\n \nmygl\n;\n\n\npublic\n \nimport\n \nderelict\n.\nopengl\n;\n\n\n\nenum\n \nmaxGLVersion\n \n=\n \nGLVersion\n.\ngl33\n;\n\n\nenum\n \nsupportDeprecated\n \n=\n \nfalse\n;\n\n\n\n// Required imports\n\n\nstatic\n \nif\n(!\nsupportDeprecated\n)\n \nmixin\n(\nglImports\n);\n\n\nelse\n \nmixin\n(\ngl_depImports\n);\n\n\n\n// Type declarations should be outside of the struct\n\n\nmixin\n \nglDecls\n!(\nmaxGLVersion\n,\n \nsupportDeprecated\n);\n\n\nstruct\n \nMyContext\n \n{\n\n    \nmixin\n \nglFuncs\n!(\nmaxGLVersion\n,\n \nsupportDeprecated\n);\n\n    \nmixin\n \nglLoaders\n!(\nmaxGLVersion\n,\n \nsupportDeprecated\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\nMyContext\n \ncontext\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is essentially what is done by the default \nglContext\n mixin. Note that in \nglDecls\n, \nglFuncs\n, and \nglLoaders\n, the second parameter is optional, with the default value of \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere is a currently unresolved issue that causes the compiler to seemingly hang when using contexts and compiling with \n-release\n. Compilation eventually succeeds, but it can take a very long time.\n\n\n\n\nLoading the OpenGL library\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe steps required to gain access to different OpenGL versions may differ across operating systems. For example, on Windows OpenGL versions up to 1.1 may be dynamically linked, but 1.2 and above must be loaded dynamically at runtime after a context has been created. On Mac OS X, all of the OpenGL versions may be dynamically linked or dynamically loaded, and in the latter case a context need not be active.\n\n\nTo hide these differences and present a unified interface on all supported platform, DerelictGL3 requires a three-step process. When using the free function configuration, those steps are:\n\n\n\n\nCall \nDerelictGL3.load\n.\n \nThis must be done before any OpenGL functions are called, but may happen before or after a context has been created, but must be done before calling \nDerelictGL3.reload\n in the last step. This will load the OpenGL shared library and all OpenGL functions up to version 1.1. Failure to load will result in an exception.\n\n\nCreate an OpenGL context.\n \nThis may occur before or after \nDerelictGL3.load\n is called, but must be done before calling \nDerelictGL3.reload\n in the next step. DerelictGL3 does not provide the means of creating an OpenGL context. For that, use either the system API (like Win32) or a third-party library such as \nSDL\n, \nGLFW\n, or \nSFML\n.\n\n\nCall \nDerelictGL3.reload\n.\n\nThis must occur after \nDerelictGL3.load\n has been called and after an OpenGL context has been created. This will load all versions that have been configured from 1.2 and up, as well as any configured extensions. For maximum portability, this function should be called every time the OpenGL context is changed.\n\n\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates. It uses the default DerelictGL3 free function configuration. It does not show the code to create the context.\n\n\nimport\n \nderelict\n.\nopengl\n;\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n    \n// Load the OpenGL shared library\n\n    \nDerelictGL3\n.\nload\n();\n\n\n    \n// Create the context using a system or third-party API\n\n    \nmyCreateContext\n();\n\n\n    \n// Now load all supported functions\n\n    \nDerelictGL3\n.\nreload\n();\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe steps are similar when using the context object configuration.\n\n\n\n\nCall \nDerelictGL3.load\n.\n \nThis must be done before any OpenGL functions are called, but may happen before or after a context has been created, but must be done before calling \nload\n on a context object in the last step. This will load the OpenGL shared library but does not load any OpenGL functions. Failure to ca ll \nDerelictGL3.load\n will result in an exception.\n\n\nCreate an OpenGL context.\n \nThis may occur before or after \nDerelictGL3.load\n is called, but must be done before calling \nload\n on a context object in the next step. DerelictGL3 does not provide the means of creating an OpenGL context. For that, use either the system API (like Win32) or a third-party library such as \nSDL\n, \nGLFW\n, or \nSFML\n.\n\n\nCall \nload\n on a context object instance.\n\nThis must occur after \nDerelictGL3.load\n as been called and after an OpenGL context has been created. For maximum portability, context objects should be created for and associated with each OpenGL context used in the program. Then, the \nload\n method can be called on each instance just once. This will load all configured OpenGL functions from 1.0 and up and any extensions that have been configured. When the OpenGL context changes, functions can be called through its associated object instance.\n\n\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates using the default \nGLContext\n type.\n\n\nimport\n \nderelict\n.\nopengl\n;\n\n\nmixin\n \nglContext\n!(\nGLVersion\n.\ngl33\n);\n\n\nGLContext\n \nmyContext\n;\n\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n    \n// Load the OpenGL shared library\n\n    \nDerelictGL3\n.\nload\n();\n\n\n    \n// Create the context using a system or third-party API\n\n    \nmyCreateContext\n();\n\n\n    \n// Now load all supported functions\n\n    \nmyContext\n.\nload\n();\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth \nDerelictGL3.reload\n and the \nload\n method of a context instance return the highest version of OpenGL that was sucessfully loaded in the form of a \nGLVersion\n value. You can also obtain the same value by calling calling \nloadedVersion\n on the \nDerelictGL3\n instance or on the context object.\n\n\nThe following loads the highest supported version, but requires OpenGL 3.3 at a minimum.\n\n\nimport\n \nderelict\n.\nopengl\n;\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nDerelictGL3\n.\nload\n();\n\n    \nmyCreateContext\n();\n\n    \nauto\n \nloaded\n \n=\n \nDerelictGL3\n.\nreload\n();\n\n    \nif\n(\nloaded\n \n<\n \nGLVersion\n.\ngl33\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nthrow\n \nnew\n \nException\n(\n\"OpenGL version too low!\"\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtensions\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhether using the default configuration or a custom one, no extensions are loaded by default. Extensions must be individually declared using string mixins unless they are part of the core specification of an OpenGL version you have configured.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nTo see which extensions are loaded along with the core versions, see the \ncore_*.d\n files in the DerelictGL3 source directory \nsource/derelict/opengl/extensions\n. Eventually, they will all be listed in this document.\n\n\n\n\nTo demonstrate, let's assume you want to enable the highest OpenGL version available and you want to make use of the OpenGL 4.3 function \nglMultiDrawArraysIndirect\n. This function is part of the \nGL_ARB_multi_draw_indirect\n extension.\n\n\nimport\n \nderelict\n.\nopengl\n;\n\n\n\nbool\n \nhasMultiDrawIndirect\n;\n\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nDerelictGL3\n.\nload\n();\n\n    \nmyCreateContext\n();\n\n    \nauto\n \nloaded\n \n=\n \nDerelictGL3\n.\nreload\n();\n\n    \nhasMultiDrawIndirect\n \n=\n \n(\nloaded\n \n>=\n \nGLVersion\n.\ngl43\n)\n \n        \n||\n \nDerelictGL3\n.\nisExtensionLoaded\n(\n\"GL_ARB_multi_draw_indirect\"\n);\n\n\n}\n \n\n\n\n\n\nisExtensionLoaded\n is also available on context objects, e.g. \nmyContext.isExtensionLoaded(extName);\n.\n\n\nWhen you are using an extension that has not been promoted to core, or you have configured DerelictGL3 to use a version lower than the one in which the extension was promoted, you must declare the extension. For the free function API, this is a one liner. For example, if you've configured OpenGL 4.1 as the highest version, but want to support the \nGL_ARB_multidraw_indirect\n extension:\n\n\nimport\n \nderelict\n.\nopengl\n;\n\n\nmixin\n \nglFreeFuncs\n!(\nGLVersion\n.\ngl41\n);\n\n\n\n// GL_ARB_multi_draw_indrect type and function pointer declarations\n\n\nmixin\n(\narbMultiDrawIndirect\n);\n\n\n\nbool\n \nhasMultiDrawIndirect\n;\n\n\n\nvoid\n \nmain\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nDerelictGL3\n.\nload\n();\n\n    \nmyCreateContext\n();\n\n    \nDerelictGL3\n.\nreload\n();\n\n    \nhasMultiDrawIndirect\n \n=\n \n            \nDerelictGL3\n.\nisExtensionLoaded\n(\n\"GL_ARB_multi_draw_indirect\"\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use extensions with context objects, you must define a custom context type. It is not currently possible to mix extensions in to the default \nGLContext\n.

Unlike other Derelict packages, DerelictGL3 releases do not correspond to any specific version of the C library. All versions of OpenGL are always supported, even though the  SharedLibVersion  construct is not. When a new version of OpenGL is released, support is added to the current DerelictGL3 release series and the patch number, rather than the minor number, is bumped in the new release version.     DerelictGL3 Version  git Branch  OpenGL Version  DerelictUtil Version  Supported      2.0.0-beta  master / 2.0  3.2.x  3.0.x  \u2714    1.0.x  1.0  1.0 - 4.5  1.0.x - 3.0.x  \u2714     The  1.0.x  series is compatible with all DerelictUtil versions, as long as it is compiled against and linked with the same version of DerelictUtil as an executable. Unfortunately, in an oversight lost to time, the  1.0.x  series uses a  derelict-util  dependency of  >=1.0.3  which disallows anything less than version  1.0.3 , but has no constraint on later versions. As such, it's possible to independently compile the DerelictGL3 library against version  1.0.x  or  2.0.x  of DerelictUtil, then attempt to link with DerelictUtil  3.0.x  when building the executable.  It's recommended to use DerelictGL3  1.0.x  only when you need compatibility with the  2.0.x  series of DerelictUtil because of other Derelict packages. If you compile DerelictGL3  1.0.x  independently, make sure you specify version  2.0.x  of DerelictUtil in your  dub.selections.json  file. Otherwise, DUB will pull down the latest DerelictUtil and link against it.  DerelictGL3  3.0.x  was overhauled to provide compile-time configuration of supported OpenGL versions and extensions. It also provides the option of wrapping all function declarations in a  struct , either automatically or in a custom type, to provide more efficient context management. All new projects should use this version. Support for the  1.0.x  series will be discontinued at some point in the future.",

This can be overridden by adding a  versions  directive to a project's DUB configuration with one of the following values.   DerelictGL3_CustomFreeFuncs   When this version is specified, the DerelictGL3 modules will not declare any types or function pointers. This must be handled by the user using a mixin template,  glFreeFuncs . The following enables only OpenGL versions 3.3 and lower:  module   mygl ;  public   import   derelict . opengl ;  mixin   glFreeFuncs !( GLVersion . gl33 );   This will enable all of the OpenGL types and function pointers for every version up to OpenGL 3.3 into the  mygl  module. Modules that need to call OpenGL functions should import  mygl .  glFreeFuncs  takes an optional parameter that will include deprecated types and function pointer declarations. This is  false  by default, but can be enabled with, e.g.,  mixin glFreeFuncs(GLVersion.gl33, true); .  With no arguments,  glFreeFuncs  will enable all supported versions of OpenGL without deprecations. This is the default behavior.   DerelictGL3_Contexts   This will configure DerelictGL3 to load the OpenGL function pointers into a  struct . To use the default implementation, mixin the  glContext  template along with the desired version:  module   mygl ;  public   import   derelict . opengl ;  mixin   glContext !( GLVersion . gl33 );  GLContext   context ;   This will enable all of the types and function pointers for every version up to OpenGL 3.3 into the  mygl  module, wrapping the function pointers (but not the types) into a structure named  GLContext , and create an instance of that type named  context . OpenGL functions can then be called via the  context  instance, e.g.  context.glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); .  Deprecated types and functions can be enabled by passing  true  as a second argument to  glContext . With no arguments,  glContext  will load all supported versions of OpenGL without deprecations (the default behavior).  Custom contexts are also supported, but they require a bit of string and template  mixin  boilerplate.  module   mygl ;  public   import   derelict . opengl ;  enum   maxGLVersion   =   GLVersion . gl33 ;  enum   supportDeprecated   =   false ;  // Required imports  static   if (! supportDeprecated )   mixin ( glImports );  else   mixin ( gl_depImports );  // Type declarations should be outside of the struct  mixin   glDecls !( maxGLVersion ,   supportDeprecated );  struct   MyContext   { \n     mixin   glFuncs !( maxGLVersion ,   supportDeprecated ); \n     mixin   glLoaders !( maxGLVersion ,   supportDeprecated );  }  MyContext   context ;   This is essentially what is done by the default  glContext  mixin. Note that in  glDecls ,  glFuncs , and  glLoaders , the second parameter is optional, with the default value of  false .   Note  There is a currently unresolved issue that causes the compiler to seemingly hang when using contexts and compiling with  -release . Compilation eventually succeeds, but it can take a very long time.",

            "text": "The steps required to gain access to different OpenGL versions may differ across operating systems. For example, on Windows OpenGL versions up to 1.1 may be dynamically linked, but 1.2 and above must be loaded dynamically at runtime after a context has been created. On Mac OS X, all of the OpenGL versions may be dynamically linked or dynamically loaded, and in the latter case a context need not be active.  To hide these differences and present a unified interface on all supported platform, DerelictGL3 requires a three-step process. When using the free function configuration, those steps are:   Call  DerelictGL3.load .  \nThis must be done before any OpenGL functions are called, but may happen before or after a context has been created, but must be done before calling  DerelictGL3.reload  in the last step. This will load the OpenGL shared library and all OpenGL functions up to version 1.1. Failure to load will result in an exception.  Create an OpenGL context.  \nThis may occur before or after  DerelictGL3.load  is called, but must be done before calling  DerelictGL3.reload  in the next step. DerelictGL3 does not provide the means of creating an OpenGL context. For that, use either the system API (like Win32) or a third-party library such as  SDL ,  GLFW , or  SFML .  Call  DerelictGL3.reload . \nThis must occur after  DerelictGL3.load  has been called and after an OpenGL context has been created. This will load all versions that have been configured from 1.2 and up, as well as any configured extensions. For maximum portability, this function should be called every time the OpenGL context is changed.   The following example demonstrates. It uses the default DerelictGL3 free function configuration. It does not show the code to create the context.  import   derelict . opengl ;  void   main ()   { \n     // Load the OpenGL shared library \n     DerelictGL3 . load (); \n\n     // Create the context using a system or third-party API \n     myCreateContext (); \n\n     // Now load all supported functions \n     DerelictGL3 . reload ();  }   The steps are similar when using the context object configuration.   Call  DerelictGL3.load .  \nThis must be done before any OpenGL functions are called, but may happen before or after a context has been created, but must be done before calling  load  on a context object in the last step. This will load the OpenGL shared library but does not load any OpenGL functions. Failure to ca ll  DerelictGL3.load  will result in an exception.  Create an OpenGL context.  \nThis may occur before or after  DerelictGL3.load  is called, but must be done before calling  load  on a context object in the next step. DerelictGL3 does not provide the means of creating an OpenGL context. For that, use either the system API (like Win32) or a third-party library such as  SDL ,  GLFW , or  SFML .  Call  load  on a context object instance. \nThis must occur after  DerelictGL3.load  as been called and after an OpenGL context has been created. For maximum portability, context objects should be created for and associated with each OpenGL context used in the program. Then, the  load  method can be called on each instance just once. This will load all configured OpenGL functions from 1.0 and up and any extensions that have been configured. When the OpenGL context changes, functions can be called through its associated object instance.   The following example demonstrates using the default  GLContext  type.  import   derelict . opengl ;  mixin   glContext !( GLVersion . gl33 );  GLContext   myContext ;  void   main ()   { \n     // Load the OpenGL shared library \n     DerelictGL3 . load (); \n\n     // Create the context using a system or third-party API \n     myCreateContext (); \n\n     // Now load all supported functions \n     myContext . load ();  }   Both  DerelictGL3.reload  and the  load  method of a context instance return the highest version of OpenGL that was sucessfully loaded in the form of a  GLVersion  value. You can also obtain the same value by calling calling  loadedVersion  on the  DerelictGL3  instance or on the context object.  The following loads the highest supported version, but requires OpenGL 3.3 at a minimum.  import   derelict . opengl ;  void   main ()   { \n     DerelictGL3 . load (); \n     myCreateContext (); \n     auto   loaded   =   DerelictGL3 . reload (); \n     if ( loaded   <   GLVersion . gl33 )   { \n         throw   new   Exception ( \"OpenGL version too low!\" ); \n     }  }",

There are two ways to enable the static binding configuration. The recommended way is to add a \nsubConfiguration\n entry to your project configuration with the value \nderelict-glfw3-static\n and link to the appropriate library, as in the following examples. Note that the example assumes linking dynamically, using the precompiled binaries from the GLFW website on Windows. In other binary distributions on Windows, the dynamic import library may simply be named \nglfw3.lib\n instead. In that case, a single \nlibs\n entry with no platform suffix will suffice.  \n\n\ndub.json\n\n\n\"dependencies\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"derelict-glfw3\"\n:\n \n\"~>4.0.0-beta\"\n\n\n}\n,\n\n\n\"subConfigurations\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n\"derelict-glfw3\"\n:\n \n\"derelict-glfw3-static\"\n\n\n}\n,\n\n\n\"libs-windows\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n[\n\"glfw3dll\"\n]\n\n\n}\n,\n\n\n\"libs-posix\"\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n[\n\"glfw3\"\n]\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndub.sdl\n\n\ndependency \n\"derelict-glfw3\"\n \n\"~>4.0.0-beta\"\n\nsubConfiguration \n\"derelict-glfw3\"\n \n\"derelict-glfw3-static\"\n\nlibs \n\"glfw3dll\"\n \nplatform\n=\n\"windows\"\n\nlibs \n\"glfw3\"\n \nplatform\n=\n\"posix\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alternative is to replace the \nsubConfiguration\n with a \nversions\n entry and give it one of two values, either \nDerelict_Static\n or \nDerelictGLFW3_Static\n.
